title: Software Requirements Specification
---

See also: [[SRS/SRS#Revision|this document revision]], and [[ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement|problem statement]]

_The following Software Requirements Specification for `tinymorph` is using [Volere Requirements Specification template](https://www.volere.org/templates/volere-requirements-specification-template/)_

## 1. Purpose of the Project

> `tinymorph` aims to explore new interfaces and workflow for [[glossary#auto-regressive model]] to help writers craft better writing artifacts. ^introduction

### 1.1 User Business

> [!important] UB-1
>
> Offer service for creative writing.

Rationale: `tinymorph` is a web-based text editor, thus, its main goal is to provide interfaces for users to write.

> [!important] UB-2
>
> Help stakeholders to create writing artifacts

Rationale: `tinymorph` will provide environment for stakeholders to do creative writing. That means writing artifacts
are self-contained, owned by users, forever.

### 1.2 Goals of the Project

_[[ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement#Goals|comprehensive lists]]_

<!-- covers both of functional and non-functional requirements -->

> [!IMPORTANT] G-1
>
> A [_file-over-app_](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor.

Rationale:

<p class="quotes">
  <i>The files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.</i> -- Steph Ango
</p>

`tinymorph` aims to amplify users' ability to write through planning and suggestion interfaces, done over files that
owned by users.

> [!IMPORTANT] G-2
>
> Planning interfaces for ideas formulation

Rationale: `tinymorph` will propose certain directions using settings configured by users for idea generations as well
as suggestions to help users _get over writers block_ or _expand on current ideas_.

> [!important] G-3
>
> Efficient attention caching for feature steering.

Rationale: Generating similarly composed features vectors every forward pass might not be the best use of available
resources. Thus, designing a caching mechanism for [[glossary#KV block]] generated as a result for feature steering via
SAEs would help overall throughput and reduce latency.

> [!important] G-4
>
> SAEs suitable for planning and suggestion for creative writing.

Rationale: Recent works show [[glossary#sparse autoencoders]] can be trained to minimise certain bias scope [@rajamanoharan2024improvingdictionarylearninggated].
This is prevalent in `tinymorph` use-cases as it needs to ablate harmful features and amplify features related to
creative writing to improve [[glossary#manual steering|steering]] direction. [[SRS/SRS#18. Open Issues|OI-2]] will also
investigate current open-issues for activation steering.

> [!important] G-5
>
> OpenAI-compatible API for LLM server.

Rationale: OpenAI's API definition has been widely adopted in the industry for deploying LLMs. OpenAI-compatible endpoint
is required for future integrations with upstream tools.

> [!important] G-6
>
> Amplify users creativity

_[[DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan#External Goals|external motivation]]_

Rationale: There are currently two incentives emerging within the industry as we approach the intelligence age:
entities that seek to build systems capable of outperforming humans with tasks at a greater degree of efficiency and
accuracy (OpenAI, Anthropic, SSI, AI21, etc.), and companies aims to utilise these systems to amplify our cognitive
self (Runway, Cohere, etc.).

Our interest lies firmly with the second group, as we believe that tools should fundamentally improve our lifes, not
replacing it. `tinymorph` is the manifestation of this belief system.

## 6. The Scope of the Work

### 6.1 The Current Situation

The problem with writers block is that it is cyclical by nature. Julia Cameron's [The Artist
Way](https://juliacameronlive.com/the-artists-way/) suggests people to commit writing a certain numbers of words
everyday, regardless of productivity and word counts. Yet, it is not as simple as "just put words down on paper".
For some, inspirations are stream of consciousness that flows in and outs, yet for others there would be times that we
would just sit, and stare at a blank Google docs. Frustration starts to creep in: "_come on, just write something, damn it!_"

We then proceed to overload our prefrontal cortex with surges of dopamine in a quest to find
inspiration: one might spend a 200 dollars on that Club Monaco tees, others might turn into 400 pages of Nietzsche's
The Gay Science to look for lines that resonate with their state of mind. In a sense, the hardest problem about writers block
is so detached from the physical act of putting down words on papers, rather a layer beyond this interface.

Engineers who are looking to expand their writing toolset might turn to conversational AI tools such as ChatGPT,
Claude, etc. to synthesize their ideas and expand on their writing. Yet, collectively we have phased out a sort of
"robotic" and "gpt-esque" tonality from these synthesized essays. Additionally, conversational tools often take
a linear approach that doesn't cater well to non-linear nature of creative writing process, where retrieval of
information are often non-deterministic. And users end up "optimizing prompt" to guide the model to generate in
a certain direction.

In the physical world, tools such as blackboards or planning books provide a canvas for users to physically interact
with such artifacts. A certain planner workflow would help writers to get over certain mental block.
With software, most tools aiming to help improve writing are often lack this planning workflow, while emphasizing on
more cookie-cutter generations templates through prompt engineering.

`tinymorph` aims to address these shortcomings. It intends to provide a more dynamic, interactive writing environment that not only offers suggestions but also
provide spatial interfaces for non-linear idea exploration.
This "How Now" view aims to replace the rigidity of current LLM-powered text editors by providing certain planning
workflow, allowing users to manually steer and direct generations based on their tonality that is closed to their true
writing style, creating a more enjoyable and cohesive writing experience.

### 6.2 The Context of the Work

`tinymorph`'s work context identifies the environment, systems, and users that the tool interacts with, defining the boundaries of its operation.
Understanding the following milestones would help `tinymorph` better help writers with their creative writing experience.

#### **Adjacent Systems**

_encapsulate related environment that provides as a base for tinymorph to build upon._

`tinymorph` will be built on top of:

- **Local file storage system**: a vault-like directory will be implemented and used for `tinymorph` to provide a workspace for users to start writing.
  This vault will act as ground truth for storing both users files as well as their configuration for `tinymorph`. By
  doing so, `tinymorph` stays true with its _==file-over-app==_ philosophy.
- **_asteraceae_ inference server**: `tinymorph`' inference server will be responsible for running LLM for generating
  suggestion and planning step. Note that no users data are stored on this given server, preserving true users' data privacy

  _("asteraceae" is the scientific name for "daisy")_

- **user devices**: `tinymorph` will offer a web-based interface, ensuring it to work on multiple platforms, operating systems that can sufficient run a modern browser.

### 6.4 Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)

The Business Use Cases (BUC) detail how `tinymorph` responds to specific business events by providing a comprehensive description of each interaction.
These descriptions ensure that the requirements for system actions are fully understood and documented, enhancing clarity during the implementation phase.

> Each BUC is carefully articulated to capture how `tinymorph` behaves in response to user actions and how each event impacts the system's workflow.
>
> The purpose of defining detailed Business Use Cases is to understand how tinymorph responds during different user scenarios. This understanding helps identify the necessary requirements and ensures the solution meets the expected functionalities without ambiguity. By examining each BUC, we can ensure that all events are accounted for, creating a robust system that addresses user needs comprehensively. These scenarios build on the events specified in section 6.3, providing a full account of system behavior.

Below are detailed BUC scenarios, specifying how `tinymorph` handles each event:

#### 1. User Uploads Document

When the user uploads or begins editing a document, `tinymorph` processes the file locally.
The document is formatted into a string, which is sent to the inference server for suggestions.
Importantly, no user data is stored on the server to enusre in preserving user privacy.
The interaction is designed to maintain a stateless transaction while providing suggestions based on user inputs.

#### 2. Generate Writing Suggestions

When a user inputs their text, tinymorph generates writing suggestions that align with the user's style preferences such as tone and clarity. These suggestions are then provided in a way that facilitates easy integration into the user’s writing process. This use case emphasizes `tinymorph`’s ability to assist users in enhancing their writing
creatively while staying true to their personal style.

#### 3. Planning Interfaces

When users receive suggestions, they are presented with a planning tab that acts as stages and potential idea flow one
can use to incorporate into their writing. This use-case demonstrates `tinymorph`'s spatial interfaces to help curate
new ideas and solve writers block

#### 4. Save Configuration Settings

Users have the ability to save their preferences including tone, writing style, and custom configurations locally to a vault directory. This ensures that each time a user interacts with tinymorph, the tool aligns with their personalized needs, without relying on cloud-based storage. The local storage approach gives users the control and flexibility they need to maintain their preferred settings.

#### 5. Inference Request Sent

User text content is formatted and sent to the inference server for generating suggestions. The request is processed on the server without saving any data, ensuring a stateless transaction that respects user privacy. This use case ensures that while the model provides sophisticated writing assistance, it does so in a privacy conscious manner.

#### 6. Display Suggestions

Once the inference server processes the request, tinymorph displays the generated writing suggestions directly within the user’s document. This helps the user see the potential improvements in real-time and decide whether to accept or reject each suggestion. This approach is designed to seamlessly integrate AI assistance into the user’s creative process.

#### 7. Manual Edits to Document

Users are encouraged to make manual edits to their document, either accepting or rejecting the suggestions made by tinymorph. The flexibility provided by this ensures users have complete creative control over the text. The manual editing process is integral to enhancing the accuracy of the content and ensuring that the suggestions align with the writer's intent.

#### 8. Save Document Locally

After editing, the user may choose to save their document locally. Tinymorph ensures that the content is securely stored on the user’s device. The emphasis on local storage enhances user control over their documents, fostering a sense of security and convenience.

#### 9. View Writing Analytics

`tinymorph` provides the user with analytical insights into their writing. These analytics might include metrics such as structure, readability, and suggested improvements. The analysis helps writers to better understand their strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing the quality of their content.

> Implement DNS security measures to ensure that DNS queries and responses are protected against tampering and spoofing.

Rationale: Securing DNS interactions prevents attackers from manipulating or rerouting network traffic. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of application data.

> [!important] SR-INT3
>
> The application will use content security policies to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.

Rationale: Content Security Policies (CSP) are an effective security control to prevent XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed in the application. CSP will help in safeguarding against data theft and maintain the integrity of the content delivered to users.

> [!important] SR-INT4
>
> Implement JWT and short-lived tokens to secure session communications.

Rationale: Utilizing JWT and short-lived tokens for session management enhances security by ensuring that session data remains protected against unauthorized access. This approach helps prevent bad actors from intercepting or tampering with session data, ensuring that user content and session details remain confidential and intact.

### 15.3 Privacy Requirements

> [!important] SR-P1
>
> The application must ensure that it does not collect or store personal information, adhering strictly to privacy by design principles.

Rationale: By not collecting personal information, the application minimizes privacy risks and complies with privacy laws and regulations. Avoiding personal data storage also reduces the need for complex data security measures, allowing the project to focus more on enhancing user experience and functionality.

### 15.4 Audit Requirements

> [!important] SR-AU1
>
> Implement monitoring of interactions with external service providers to ensure their use complies with security policies and performance expectations.

Rationale: Monitoring interactions with external service providers is essential to ensure they are used within the bounds of security protocols and that their performance aligns with the application's requirements. This helps in detecting any deviations that might compromise security or functionality, allowing for quick mitigation actions to maintain the integrity and reliability of the application services.

### 15.5 Immunity Requirements

> [!important] SR-IM1
>
> Employ up to date security measures to protect against known threats and vulnerabilities, including regular updates and patches to the software components.

Rationale: Keeping software updated ensures that known vulnerabilities are addressed, which will protect the application and its data from emerging threats.

> [!important] SR-IM2
>
> Configure the application to minimize the surface area for attacks by disabling unused services and endpoints.

Rationale: Minimizing the attack surface reduces the number of potential entry points for attackers, enhancing the overall security of the application. This proactive measure significantly lowers the risk of exploitations and helps maintain system integrity.

## 16. Cultural Requirements

### 16.1 Cultural Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT] CulR-CR1
>
> English supports

Rationale: English will be supported for alpha release of `tinymorph`. This is due to the limited capabilities of models when dealing with multilingual inputs.

> [!IMPORTANT] CulR-CR2
>
> Cultural reference must be factual

Rationale: If given cultural references are generated, it must utilize tools to fact-check given suggestions (using web-search).

> [!IMPORTANT] CulR-CR3
>
> Support left-to-right (LTR) reading flow

Rationale: Panels will be presented in LTR manner. RTL will be supported once multilingual are added.

## 17. Compliance Requirements

### 17.1 Legal Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT] CompR-LR1
>
> Suggestion must follow strict US copyright law.

Rationale: Certain suggestions, if any, uses additional contents, references must be made to ensure copyright law compliance.

> [!IMPORTANT] CompR-LR2
>
> [SOC2](https://www.vanta.com/products/soc-2) compliance

Rationale: `tinymorph` should follow SOC-2 attestation for its inference server.

> [!IMPORTANT] CompR-LR2
>
> Users permission to run inference against their content

Rationale: `tinymorph` will require users' inputs to make corresponding suggestions. In other words, existing user content will be sent during inference requests.

### 17.2 Standards Compliance Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT] CompR-SCR1
>
> follows standard HTTP protocol for client-server communication

Rationale: `tinymorph` will adhere to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1) standards as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 2616 (for HTTP/1.1).

## 18. Open Issues

> [!question] OI-1
>
> How should we compose correct features matrix to ensure correct steering?

Rationale: We can train intepreter networks to extract human-readable activations layers (referred as "features")
[@cunningham2023interim] [@templeton2024scaling], but features alone won't offer too much value for end users
(engineers, writers).

`tinymorph` then must be able to compose multiple activations that represents certain tonality,
in which a auto-interp pipeline [@juang2024autointerp] should be implemented to guide base models to generate in
certain direction.

> [!question] OI-2
>
> What datasets one should use to train [[glossary#sparse autoencoders|SAEs]]?

Rationale: [@goodfire2024research] demonstrated [LMSys-1M chat datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m) are great fit to train SAE for chat application
specifically. For the interface for planning ideas a more general datasets that contains more essays, paragraphs might
be more beneficial.

> [!question] OI-3
>
> For a planning interface, what if we add tool use (such as web-search) to enhance correctness in generations?

Rationale: RAG-infused pipeline [@lewis2021retrievalaugmentedgenerationknowledgeintensivenlp] has been widely adopted
in industry-related workflows to reduce LLM hallucination. For steering specifically, this might be useful given the
additional context for online blog posts to influence certain direction writers want to formulate their ideas.

> [!question] OI-3
>
> Effectiveness against fine-tuned models?

Rationale: Fine-tuned models are a distilled version of the base models that is trained to perform generations in
a given format/text. Methods such as [[glossary#low-rank adapters|LoRA]] has been proven to be useful for steering
generations purely through prompt. The questions remains whether intuitively having SAEs to steer generations at the
activation level would prove to be more useful than specifically fine-tuned models.

> [!question] OI-4
>
> [file-over-app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) philosophy for building a text editor?

Rationale: The end goal is to build a text editor, which means we are building on top of the notion of "files". We
rarely have to think about files nowadays in our daily tasks, yet we are still operating with them on a daily basis:
Photos stored on your iPhone., music catalog saved in Spotify, knowledge pages in Notion etc. The industry seemingly to
replace this primitive with something stored "on the cloud". I do think there are arguments to be made to give back
this heuristic back to the users, if we are thinking about building digital artifacts that will last long after we are
gone. Additionally, it will greatly simplify any internal logics.

> [!question] OI-5
>
> Inference performance for server deployment versus on-device?

Rationale: For the past year, the need for efficient inference to run these language models has been top priorities for
companies to deploy these models in production. Framework such as vLLM [@kwon2023efficient], lmdeploy [@2023lmdeploy]
offers different trade-off for running efficient inference on server. Given `tinymorph` will offer a web interface, how
should we evaluate given frameworks to use in conjunction with trained SAEs. Additionally, for on-device inference, we
must also investigate how one can run the models locally.

> [!question] OI-6
>
> Multilingual support?

Rationale: LLMs we are considering for `tinymorph` doesn't have good multilingual support. This has to do with a lack
of datasets during pre-training of these foundation models. Therefore, to fully support analysing essays with language
other than English, we must use base models that support multilingual, with the likes of [aya](https://cohere.com/research/aya), followed with a set of SAEs trained against this model.

The requirements helps me to structure the project and write down tasks needed to be done to build `tinymorph`.

I think requirements documentations are two-edged swords. Thinking from a perspectives of a person who write codes,
requirements documents helps me to write down what needs to be done. However, some sections are some what too vague and
often share the same terminology with other sections, which leads to some duplications and sometimes premature
optimization.

Most of the functional features were inspired from the chat I have with one of my friends in NYC, and the ideas stems
from [@goodfire2024research] work on steerable Llama.

Well, I think Concurrency course 3BB4 would help with building inference server.

Training models, building sparse autoencoders, designing new UX for interacting with text, implementation activation
caching for frequency used paged KV blocks.

I usually send the author of those papers and email and they usually respond back with answers with a lot of details.
A lot of experimentation with existing infrastructure (meaning writing models and implementing papers in PyTorch),
which I have been doing during my free time.

One of the positive aspects of working on the SRS deliverable was the level of detail we were able to capture for each of the sections. Taking the time to explore the user needs thoroughly made it easier to articulate requirements that are meaningful and aligned with the project objectives. The iterative discussions for each section especially when working on the “Scope of Work” and “Stakeholders,” helped ensure that all aspects of tinymorph's functionality and purpose were effectively covered, which contributing to a more cohesive document.

A significant pain point was maintaining precision without overcomplicating the requirements or stepping outside the project's scope. This was especially challenging in sections like "Usability and Humanity Requirements" where striking the right balance between thoroughness and clarity required revisiting multiple drafts. I tackled this by actively rewriting areas that felt unclear and incorporating peer feedback to refine my approach. Another challenge was determining the relevance of certain sections like access requirements, which we ultimately decided to remove as they did not apply to our stateless system.

Our requirements were primarily based on our team's understanding of the tinymorph project's objectives and the target audience's needs. Insights from brainstorming sessions within the team and individual expertise shaped critical areas such as the "Look and Feel Requirements" and "Security Requirements". This internal feedback loop helped refine requirements to align with the vision for `tinymorph` as a creative writing tool that emphasizes user privacy and control.

Courses such as "Human-Computer Interfaces" have been invaluable for shaping our approach to creating an intuitive user experience, which is key for `tinymorph`. Additionally, "Software Requirements and Security Considerations" has helped me better understand how to structure the SRS and ensure consistency throughout the document, while the "Application of Machine Learning" course has given insights into how to effectively integrate ML models to enhance creative writing.

To complete this capstone project successfully, we need to expand our domain knowledge in creative writing tools and user psychology to better tailor the experience for writers. We also need backend expertise such as in deploying cloud-based inference servers and securely processing requests. UI/UX design skills are essential for creating an engaging and intuitive interface, and we also need to enhance our team management and communication skills to ensure smooth collaboration throughout the development process.

For domain knowledge, we could either study literature on effective writing tools and user workflows or conduct interviews with potential users to understand their needs better. I plan to engage directly with users for more practical insight. Backend expertise can be developed through online courses or by building hands on cloud based projects. We will try to have our backend focused member pursue hands on projects to gain more practical experience. For UI/UX, a combination of online courses and prototyping in tools like Figma will be pursued by designers like me, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. To improve team management and communication, we will focus on applying best practices during our regular meetings to enhance team coordination.

1.  Something that went well in this deliverable was that it allowed me to clear up my past confusion as to what we are actually building. I focused on constraints and functional requirements, as the main sections and thus I really got a chance to understand more about how the product will actually function.

2.  One of the main pain points I experienced was clarifying the functional scope of the project. Initially, it was challenging to align the technical requirements with the vision of the product, particularly when defining specific features like offline mode and version control. To resolve this, I had several discussions with the team to ensure that we were all on the same page regarding the project's goals and limitations, particularly for the first release.

3.  Several requirements related to model tuning and steering were heavily influenced by discussions with supervisor and fellow peers. Features like manual control over text generation, tone and style customization, and planning-related suggestions all were brought up in meetings and lead to related requirements. Conversations also highlighted the importance of allowing users to fine-tune model behavior to meet their writing goals, leading to the inclusion of advanced options like steering hyperparameters and inputting past writing samples for better model adaptation.

4.  Courses like Real-Time Systems and Introduction to Machine Learning will be particularly valuable for this capstone. Real-Time Systems helps with understanding performance constraints and system responsiveness, while the Machine Learning course provides the theoretical foundation necessary to implement language models and customization features within tinymorph.

5.  As a team, we will need to acquire expertise in model fine-tuning and language model behavior, especially related to LoRA and customizing language models for specific use cases. Additionally, we need to strengthen skills in front-end web development to create an intuitive and user-friendly editor interface, and cloud infrastructure management to efficiently scale and deploy the system.

6.  Model fine-tuning and language model behavior (Aron and Waleed):
    Approach 1: Take specialized courses or tutorials on fine-tuning and language model behavior to understand the technicalities of adapting models for specific writing tasks.
    Approach 2: Experiment with open-source models, working on personal or side projects that involve fine-tuning models for specific applications.

Front-end web development (Nebras):

- Approach 1: Follow a structured curriculum in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on platforms like Udemy.
- Approach 2: Collaborate on open-source front-end projects to get hands-on experience and immediate feedback from the developer community.

Cloud infrastructure management (Nebras and Lucas):

- Approach 1: Use platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to follow tutorials and labs related to setting up scalable cloud infrastructure.
- Approach 2: Participate in cloud computing hackathons to quickly learn cloud architecture and deployment strategies in a competitive setting.

  1. The part of task division went quick, we choose to use communication in group to resolve the confusions. The feedback in teams is quick in response.<br>
  2. I am still not fully catch up the background knowledge about this project, and for some of the decisions I'm still not on the same page with my peers. Self-demand learning and communications are definately needed for following procedures.<br>
  3. Most of the requirements are from peers as this is also a texting tool we can use for ourselves. We discussed the requiremnts from the user's perspective of view.<br>
  4. COMPSCI 4ML3, the course about machine learning gave me some theoretical knowledge background for the project. The SFWRENG 3X03 is also useful as guidance to have some overview of developing a project.<br>
  5. SAE training is the skill I need for this project. It is a feature extraction phase on user input to get token for larger model to run. Some knowledge on applied machine laerning is also important to bring this project to practice.<br>
  6. We have gathered related website about the SAE training, with the github project as tutorial to have a look. Some paper from google scholar is also greatly helpful for self-demand learning needed in this project. These two approches are recommanded because they allow self-paced learning asynchronously, matching to individual time slot.
