## Problem Statement

### Problem

<p class="quotes">
  <i>To know the world one must construct it.</i> -- Pavese
</p>

Alan Kay's [@AlanKay1972, 11] "Personal Computer for Children of All Ages" posited the Dynabook, a portable device that empower
users at all ages to explore and learn. The Dynabook, a manifestation of Kay's visions for personal computing,
aspired to be more than a mere tool: _a creative medium for nurturing one's expression_.

Fast foward to the $21^{\text{st}}$ century, software has been comoditised, the engine of transformations that enhance
every corner of our life. Simultaneously, we've seen exponential growth in the capabilities of machine learning
systems as well as the general push of these system into the mainstream, particularly large language models (LLMs).
This confluence exihibits both opportunities and challenges. As these systems exihibit emergent properties of
intelligence, how should we craft interfaces that promote users' **agency** and encourage a sense of personalisation
through interactions with these systems, rather than simply provide a tool for automation?

Imagine you are an engineer who do creative writing as a hobby. You often curate topics and ideas from what people are
disucssing on social media, then categorise them into themes to construct your arguments. There are plethora of tools
out there that you can use to help you with this tasks. If you are abit adventurous, you might want to run your own
models to specifically fit your requirements, you might find yourself in the land of _auto-regressive models_: GPTs and friends.

Auto-regressive models are great at surfacing machines' representation of the world through a simple interface: given
a blob of text, the model will generate a contiguous piece of text that it predicts would be the most likely.
For example, if you give it a Wikipedia article, the model should yield the rest of that said article.
Given this heuristic, we observe the rise of conversational UI (CUIs) through chat modality.

CUIs are great since it is a thin wrapper around this interface, but we often find these in support portals, orders
forms, etc. where a larger sets of information is required. However, for tasks that requires exploration, such as
research, where frequent retrieval of information is required, CUIs are not a good fit, since users will have to
constantly keep track of this information in their core memory (for no reason).

Therefore, `tinymorph` aims to be an exploration into how we can curate interfaces for text generations models to
amplify ourselves through software, aligning with what Alan has imagined for personal computing.

### Inputs and Outputs

Characterize the problem in terms of "high level" inputs and outputs. Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.

### Stakeholders

### Environment

Hardware and software environment

## Goals

## Stretch Goals

## Challenge Level and Extras

State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic). The challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or something else. Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its challenge level. You should include your rationale for the selected level. Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.

Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to make up for a less advanced challenge level. Potential extras include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc. Normally the maximum number of extras will be two. Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.
