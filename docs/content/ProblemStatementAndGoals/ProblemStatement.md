## Problem

<p class="quotes">
  <i>To know the world one must construct it.</i> -- Pavese
</p>

With software deeply embedded in everyday life and the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need for interfaces that amplify user agency and encourage personalized interaction, rather than mere automation. Existing conversational interfaces (CUIs) often struggle with complex tasks and the structuring of extensive information, especially affecting creative writers like engineers who seek coherent, non-linear thought exploration. To address this challenge, `tinymorph` aims to introduce novel spatial and visual interfaces for text generation to enhance cognitive exploration and creativity in writing.


## Inputs and Outputs

Inputs from users' perspective:

1. A writing sample or topic of the userâ€™s choice (e.g., essay on growth)
2. Personal preferences for tonality and writing style
3. External information sources related to topic at hand
4. Context of the topic as well as desired goals.

Outputs from `tinymorph`:

1. A text-based [[glossary#inlay hints]] suggestions from models
2. left-to-right (LTR) sequential panel to get users feedback on [[glossary#manual steering]]


## Stakeholders

`tinymorph` main stakeholders include writers, and engineers whose write. `tinymorph` seeks to help writers to be more
productive in their writing, getting over their creative block. Additionally, `tinymorph` also aims to encourage
engineers who write to be more creative and structure with their writing, while stay true to their tone. Writing, at
the end of the day, are very personal, which means a tool should not dictate how one should write.

## Environment

The following encapsulates both hardware and software environment for `tinymorph`:

### hardware.

- For local [[glossary#inference]], GPUs will be preferred for faster [[glossary#time-to-first-tokens]] over CPUs.
- For users' own hosted inference server, it will requires to have internet connection for running inference.
- `tinymorph` is a text editor, therefore it would be able to run on any modern computer regardless of operating system.

### software.

- Cross-platform support
- A series of [[glossary#sparse autoencoders|SAEs]] will be trained and used for feature steering.
- Support for offline inference (users can run LLMs locally).
- Minimal dependencies with intuitive UIs to demonstrate `tinymorph`'s capabilities.

## Goals

- A [_file-over-app_](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) web-based text editor.
- User feedback-loop for steering through planning.
- Efficient activation caching for feature steering.
- Functional SAEs for guided steering.
- OpenAI-compatible API for LLM server.

## Stretch Goals

- local inference.
- integrations with different device forms (tablets, e-readers).
- Cross-platform GUI.

## Challenge Level and Extras

Challenge level for `tinymorph` is advanced, since the project is exploring what is possible to build AI-native
interfaces. It involves the field of [[glossary#mechanistic interpretability]], which is a relatively new field in alignment
research that involves a lot of domain knowledge into the inner working of transformers circuits.

Extras that we wish to pursue: Design Thinking, Research.

Reasoning:

1. Design Thinking: `tinymorph` will explore new interactions for writing, which means design thinking is required for
   us to prototype on ideas.
2. Research: The field of mechanistic interpretability is considered relatively new, in which there are exciting
   research happening. We will explore this to understand how we can utilise manual editing activations rather than driving the model through a system prompt.

### Reflection

Writing this document helps me structure my thoughts surrounding the problem
definition and somewhat confirm an intuition I have towards this problem. Interfaces for personal computing are
supposed to be open-ended to surprise ourselves with new ways to create, therefore, I think it is important for me to
write down these thoughts. At the end of the day, writing is a form of lossiness as mutation, turning a "net into a line".

The main pain point I have during writing the problem statement includes declaring the scope for hardware and software
requirements. We did have an internal discussion whether to build a GUI text-editor or refer to a web-based one. After
a quick discussion, we decided that given everyone expertise and preference with the web, our main focus for capstone would be a
web-based interface.

We did consult with our supervisor to limit down the scope for both the UX work as well as potential avenue for ML research.
We established a clear boundaries for UX components we would develop that supplement the core ML work we are going to
do (which is mechanistic interpretability).

    Historically, the seminar work from Alan Turing laid the foundation for exploring the possibilities of a thinking machine [@10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433].
    Subsequently, the development of AI had taken a symbolic approach, popularized
    through decision-tree reasonings and expert systems -- world representation through high-level and human-readable
    symbols to manipulate the results. Haugeland referred to these systems as Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) [@10.7551/mitpress/4626.001.0001]

    However, GOFAI presented its limitation and led us into a "AI Winter", largely due to the cynicism of the general research community
    as well as a reduction in funding at most research labs. [@handler2008avoidanotheraiwinter]

    Given the rise to Moore's Law and the expontential amount of computing and [[glossary#data|data]] a new approach
    centered around statistical methods and [[glossary#connectionism|connectionist]] networks arose, and referred as "New Fangled AI" (NFAI).
    Machine learning system nowadays are also known as NFAI systems.
