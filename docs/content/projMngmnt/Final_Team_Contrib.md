This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the final demonstration and documentation. The time period of interest is the time between Rev 0 and the Final documentation.

## Team Meeting Attendance

For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the time period of interest. This number should be determined from the meeting issues in the team's repo. The first entry in the table should be the total number of team meetings held by the team.

| Student            | Meetings |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Total              | 5        |

The weekly stand-up meeting is agreed by team members as a time slot to sync up the development progress and any important information from TA meeting or lecture, along with the task divisions of the deliverables writing. It also sometimes works as a knowledge sharing session among group members to conduct Q&A about the backgroup theory of the project, when there is a mentioned research direction raised by the supervisor. There are 5 team-wide weekly stand-up meeting after the Rev0, and all group members attended the meeting. 

## Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance

For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have they attended over the time period of interest. This number should be determined from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo. The first entry in the table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the team. If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.

| Student            | Meetings |
