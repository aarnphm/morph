The weekly stand-up meeting is agreed by team members as a time slot to sync up the development progress and any important information from TA meeting or lecture, along with the task divisions of the deliverables writing. It also sometimes works as a knowledge sharing session among group members to conduct Q&A about the backgroup theory of the project, when there is a mentioned research direction raised by the supervisor. There are 5 team-wide weekly stand-up meeting after the Rev0, and all group members attended the meeting.

## Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance

For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have they attended over the time period of interest. This number should be determined from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo. The first entry in the table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the team. If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.

| Waleed Malik       | 2        |
| Zhiwei Li          | 2        |

The team has demonstrated a strong commitment to attending supervisor meetings with Dr. Swati Mishra and preparing for potential stakeholder interactions. Each member prioritized these meetings, and absences occurred only when significant obligations or emergencies arose. In such cases, members provided appropriate notice in advance, ensuring transparency and allowing the team to adjust as needed. This level of communication has helped maintain accountability and demonstrated each member’s dedication to the project and to Dr. Mishra’s guidance. There are 2 meetings with supervisor Mishra after Rev0 to receive guidance for final demo preparations.

| Waleed Malik       | 1        |
| Zhiwei Li          | 1        |
