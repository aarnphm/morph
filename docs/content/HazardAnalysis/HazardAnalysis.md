## Introduction

The tinymorph application is a web-based text editor designed to assist writers in crafting creative content through AI-driven suggestions and planning interfaces. A hazard, in this context, is any potential condition or system failure that can lead to undesirable outcomes for the user or the system. These hazards may arise from system malfunctions, improper user interactions, or issues related to the underlying AI models. Identifying and mitigating these hazards is crucial to ensure that users have a safe and reliable experience.

## Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis

The scope of this hazard analysis focuses on key components of the tinymorph system, including the user interface, AI model integration, and local data handling. The analysis aims to identify potential hazards that could lead to various losses, such as:

- Loss of user data, including unsaved content or incorrect suggestions.
- Loss of system functionality, resulting in crashes or unresponsive behavior.
- Loss of user trust due to breaches in data security or privacy.

By examining these hazards, the analysis seeks to outline preventive measures to avoid and minimize these losses, ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely while protecting user content and experience.

## System Boundaries and Components

Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards. You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major ones. For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include each individual piece of hardware. If your software will have a database, or an important library, these are also potential components.

## Critical Assumptions

These assumptions that are made about the software or system. You should minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards. For instance, you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include this potential failure mode.

## Failure Mode and Effect Analysis

Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.

The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR. The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new requirements.

If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional documentation, and/or test cases.

## Safety and Security Requirements

Newly discovered requirements. These should also be added to the SRS. (A rationale design process how and why to fake it.)

## Roadmap

Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline? Which requirements will be implemented in the future?

## Appendix --- Reflection

1. What went well while writing this deliverable?
2. What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?
3. Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how did they come about?
4. Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in software products. Why are they important to consider?
