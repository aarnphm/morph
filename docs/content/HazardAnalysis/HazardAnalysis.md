## Introduction

The following entails the Hazard Analysis of `morph`

![[SRS/SRS#^introduction|intro]]

## Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis

The purpose of this hazard analysis is to:

- Identify potential hazards in `morph`'s operation
- Analyze failure modes and their effects
- Define safety requirements and mitigation strategies
- Guide development priorities for risk reduction

This analysis covers the web-based text editor, its LLM inference system, user interactions, and data handling within
`morph`.

By examining these hazards, the analysis seeks to outline preventive measures to avoid and minimize these losses, ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely while protecting user content and experience.

## System Boundaries

The following defines system boundaries for `morph`:

### Core Functionalities

#### User interface

- User can compose, modify and refine their writing through spatial interfaces for non-linear exploration.
- UI of the editor includes components of text editor, steering controller and posted-notes dashboard for suggestion.

#### Steering control panel

- Refers to options panels allowing users to adjust and change preferences accordingly based on what they want their
  suggestion to focus on.

#### Local file storage system

- maintains file-over-app philosophy, allowing users full control of the artifacts they create

#### Inference engine (asteraceae)

- LLM inference engine used for ideas generations and steering.
- mainly used as backend for interfaces for suggestions.

#### LLM-based suggestion generations

- suggestion generated from said inference engine to cultivate ideas and thoughts for writing piece.

### Interactions

#### Infrastructure reliability

- First iterations of LLM engine will depend on running inference on a remote server, which depends on reliable network
  connection.
- Uptime and performance of servers must be reliable during high traffic usage.

#### File system operations

- File system operations are critical for `morph` to function properly, where it allows users to include files as
  context or saving their progress.

### Components outside the boundary

#### User devices and platforms

- `morph` aims to provide support on cross platforms, and supports running on modern browsers.

#### Networking connections

- The system will rely on networking connections to communicate with the inference engine.

## Definition of Hazard

The definition of a hazard in this document is adapted from Nancy Leveson's work[^hazard].

> [!important] Definition
>
> Any attribute of `morph` that when combined with specific external conditions, could result in a negative impact on system operations or user experience.

In the context of `morph`, hazard is related to:

- Loss or corruption of user data
- Breach of user privacy
- System malfunction affecting user workflow
- Generation of harmful or inappropriate content
- Degradation of system performance
- Security vulnerabilities

[^hazard]: Nancy Leveson, [How to Perform Hazard Analysis on a "System-of-Systems"](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/SOS-hazard-analysis.pdf)

## Critical Assumptions

Except for the assumption that the team has no control over the user's hardware, no critical assumptions are being made for `morph` that would limit the scope of mitigating or eliminating potential hazards.

## Failure Mode and Effect Analysis

### Hazards Out of Scope

- Physical hardware failures
- Operating system incompatibilities
- Network infrastructure issues
- Browser implementation differences
- Third-party service disruptions

The first three are out of scope given they are managed by users, and the team don't have any controls over this.

For browser implementation difference, we follow the principle of least privilege, and all interactions will be
implemented according to [Web APIs standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Browser implementation
difference therefore, out of scope as it is dependent on the browsers' developers to ensure these APIs are implemented
accordingly

For services disruptions, we rely on third-party services' SLA to host our inference engine, thus we don't have overall
control over the service's availability.

> These hazards and risks connected the aforementioned assumptions can't be completely solved; instead, they will be
> mitigated as much as possible.

## Safety and Security Requirements

Requirements intended for inclusion in Revision 0.2 of the Security Requirements section of the SRS document are highlighted in bold. Bolded items also include notes explaining the absence of specific requirements.

### Access Requirements

**Not applicable given the application is open source, and inference server are exposed over a HTTPS endpoints.**

### Integrity Requirements

![[SRS/SRS#15.2 Integrity Requirements|SRSIR]]

> [!important] SR-INT5
>
> Ensure data integrity for local storage.

Rationale: Corrupted file format can lead to loss in data. This applies to both configurations and users' files. See H2.3

> [!important] SR-INT6
>
> Fair feature steering SAEs

Rationale: SAEs must comply to certain features, stay true to trained tonality (for example Raymond Carver's SAEs should depict his writing style), and the system should reject inappropriate suggestions. This is to ensure that the system is not biased towards certain features.

### Privacy Requirements

![[SRS/SRS#15.3 Privacy Requirements|SRSPR]]

### Audit Requirements

![[SRS/SRS#15.4 Audit Requirements|SRSAR]]

### Immunity Requirements

![[SRS/SRS#15.5 Immunity Requirements|SRSImR]]

## Roadmap

The following roadmap for safety requirements will be divided into three phases:

1. Reviewing the SRS and the FEMA table to ensure that the requirements are well-defined and clear.

2. references and crystalized some requirements we think of.

3. Most Integritty requirements are already in place, but we need additional SR-INT5, SR-INT6. We think it is good to
   bring it up here instead of SRS (though subject to merge back to [[SRS/SRS]])

4. Two possible risks:

- Data Loss/Corruption Risk: Loss of intellectual property and creative work can be devastating for users> which could
  lead to loss in trust from the users.
- Security Risk: Can lead to exposure of sensitive personal or professional information. May result in compliance violations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

The hazard analysis process went well in terms of identifying potential risks within the `morph` project. The structured approach allowed us to effectively define the system boundaries, assess the components involved, and categorize hazards by focusing on different aspects such as system integrity, security, and user experience. Collaborating as a team to discuss and refine these hazards helped ensure a better understanding of possible system vulnerabilities. Breaking down the analysis into well defined sections allowed for greater organization and helped us consider multiple perspectives on the potential risks to both users and the system.

One of the pain points we experienced was determining the level of detail required for defining hazards and the justifications for the safety and security requirements. It was challenging to decide how specific each hazard needed to be without overcomplicating the document. To resolve this we opted for a balance between general definitions and more detailed justifications, making sure each hazard's implications were understood without overwhelming the document with unnecessary technical details. Another issue was the integration of third-party API related hazards. Understanding the exact scope of our control over these external components was difficult, so we spent time clarifying system boundaries and ensuring that our analysis accurately reflected the control we had over each component.

Before starting this deliverable, we had already identified risks related to data privacy, data integrity, and maintaining a consistent user experience. However, during the hazard analysis process new risks emerged such as incorrect or harmful outputs from the model steering controls and the risks associated with steering the LLM beyond normal parameters. These risks came about when we examined the system from a more user-centered perspective and considered potential unintended outcomes from users tweaking model parameters excessively. Additionally, hazards associated with third party API downtime or rate limiting became more apparent as we started detailing the components outside our system boundary and recognizing our reliance on those external systems.

Two other significant risks in software products include data privacy risks and user experience risks. Data privacy risks involve improper handling of sensitive user information, which can lead to security breaches and legal consequences. It's crucial to minimize privacy risks to protect user trust and comply with data protection laws. User experience risks can arise from confusing or inconsistent interfaces, poor system performance, or model-generated content that misaligns with user expectations. Poor user experience can result in reduced adoption of the product and overall dissatisfaction, directly impacting the success of the project. Both of these risks are important to consider because they affect how users perceive and trust the software, which is critical for the long term viability of the `morph` project.

1. One of the key successes was that the hazard analysis allowed the team to delve deeper into the system's design and implementation details. By thinking through both extreme cases and everyday uses of the application, the team was able to better define the interface and architectural requirements. For instance, it became clearer that privacy-related requirements needed to ensure that any cached or stored data pertains solely to model outputs (suggestions) rather than actual user input.

2. One major challenge was the difficulty of identifying all potential hazards without the benefit of fully testing the software. Since many risks only emerge during actual software use, it was difficult to predict all hazards upfront. This was resolved by acknowledging that interactive software development is iterative, and hazards will need to be continually reassessed as the system evolves and undergoes user testing.

3. Before starting the hazard analysis, the team had already discussed user privacy risks. Specifically, the need to avoid storing sensitive user input like private writings had been considered. Instead, the system would only store model-generated suggestions specific to the user's context. While conducting the hazard analysis, the team identified additional risks related to software security, particularly around ensuring encryption and safeguarding data during transit and storage. These additional risks came to light after conducting more research into similar applications and their security vulnerabilities.

4. In any software that processes user-generated content, privacy is a critical concern. Failing to protect user data can lead to breaches that not only harm users but also damage the company’s reputation. It is crucial to implement encryption, secure storage practices, and limit data collection to mitigate such risks. A software product can also face risks if it fails to meet usability expectations. Poorly designed interfaces can lead to frustration, reduced productivity, or even users abandoning the product. It's important to ensure that software is intuitive and accessible to its intended users, accommodating various levels of technical expertise.

1. We still have quick devision on the task of this document, and followed the right hierarchy.

2. The core part of this documentation is challenging for me. We agreed to assign better suitable team member for it to resolve the problem.

3. We had some estimation on the api of language model, which might become harzard when they are not stable. After our discussion we settled down on the architecture of interface-server connections and we found some more possible harzards about the connection.

4. Security risk, which might include misuse of the user's data. This may lead to personal information leak and further legal problem. Performance risk, which might include lagging on the user interface and slow in response. This affects the user experience a lot and may cause their drop on trust of the software in the future.
