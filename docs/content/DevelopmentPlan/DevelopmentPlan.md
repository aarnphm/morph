Put your introductory blurb here. Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of what is contained in the report.

Additional information on the development plan can be found in the [lecture slides](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads).

## Confidential Information?

State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or not. If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in place.

For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential information to protect.

## IP to Protect

State whether there is IP to protect. If there is, point to the agreement. All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also required to sign the "Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement."

## Copyright License

What copyright license is your team adopting. Point to the license in your repo.

## Team Meeting Plan

How often will you meet? where?

If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online

How often will you meet with your industry advisor? when? where?

Will meetings be virtual? At least some meetings should likely be in-person.

How will the meetings be structured? There should be a chair for all meetings. There should be an agenda for all meetings.

## Team Communication Plan

Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.

## Team Member Roles

You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker, leader, meeting chair, reviewer. Assigning specific people to those roles is not necessary at this stage. In a student team the role of the individuals will likely change throughout the year.

## Workflow Plan

- How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
- How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue classification, etc.?
- Use of CI/CD

## Project Decomposition and Scheduling

- How will you be using GitHub projects?
- Include a link to your GitHub project

How will the project be scheduled? This is the big picture schedule, not details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline for deadlines.

## Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project? What will you demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that you will be able to overcome this risk?

## Expected Technology

What programming language or languages do you expect to use? What external libraries? What frameworks? What technologies. Are there major components of the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of libraries that provide the required functionality. For projects with machine learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?

The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course of the project. The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way; it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation choices are project constraints. However, recording our initial thoughts on implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a project. It may also help with early identification of areas where project members will need to augment their training.

Topics to discuss include the following:

- Specific programming language
- Specific libraries
- Pre-trained models
- Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
- Specific unit testing framework
- Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
- Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI is not being done
- Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if appropriate
- Tools you will likely be using?

git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.

## Coding Standard

What coding standard will you adopt?

## Appendix --- Reflection

Not required for CAS 741

1. Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the project?
2. In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using CI/CD?
3. What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any, and how did you resolve them?

## Appendix --- Team Charter

borrows from [University of Portland Team Charter](https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf)

### External Goals

What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project. These are the goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project. Potential goals are to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in interviews, or to get an A+, etc.

### Attendance

#### Expectations

What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?

#### Acceptable Excuse

What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline? What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?

#### In Case of Emergency

What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team deliverable?

### Accountability and Teamwork

#### Quality

What are your team's expectations regarding the quality of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the deliverables that members bring to the team?

#### Attitude

What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas, interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding team member contributions? Do you want to introduce a code of conduct? Do you want a conflict resolution plan? Can adopt existing codes of conduct.

#### Stay on Track

What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage members whose performance is below expectations? What are the consequences for someone not contributing their fair share?

You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and instructor for this.

You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc. What are the consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets? Do they need to bring the coffee to the next team meeting? Does the team need to make an appointment with their TA, or the instructor? Are there incentives for reaching targets early?

#### Team Building

How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)?

#### Decision Making

How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus? Vote? How will you handle disagreements?
