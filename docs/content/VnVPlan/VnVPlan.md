title: System Verification and Validation Plan
---

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for `morph`, a web-based text editor that explores new interfaces for machine-assisted creative writing. The plan ensures that morph meets its primary objectives: providing spatial interfaces for non-linear exploration of writing, implementing efficient feature steering through sparse autoencoders (SAEs), and maintaining a file-over-app philosophy that preserves user agency.
The V&V activities described in this document cover both the web-based editor (morph) and the ML inference server (asteraceae). Key areas of validation include:

- Verification of the planning interface and suggestion generation capabilities
- Testing of feature steering mechanisms using SAEs
- Validation of the OpenAI-compatible inference API
- Assessment of system performance, particularly Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and throughput
- Evaluation of user interaction patterns and accessibility features
- Verification of security measures and data privacy controls

#### Rationale and Benchmark References for Performance Metrics

The selected performance metrics for `morph` are informed by community benchmarks and design considerations typical of real-time LLM-assisted applications. These targets are meant to ensure low-latency interactions without requiring large-scale infrastructure.

- **Time to First Token (TTFT):** The 200–500ms range is consistent with expectations for latency-sensitive tools like chat interfaces and writing assistants. Although OpenAI does not provide exact TTFT values, their [rate limit documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) emphasizes prompt, sub-second responses. This threshold ensures users receive suggestions quickly enough to maintain creative flow.

- **Throughput:** A target of approximately 300 tokens/second at batch size 4 reflects typical performance observed in community benchmarks for models like LLaMA 2 and Mistral 7B using optimized inference engines such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm#benchmarks). On modern GPUs like the A100 or RTX 4090, these rates are frequently achievable in single-instance deployments without distributed scaling.

These targets are chosen to ensure:
- Responsive, interactive text generation
- Compatibility with moderately powerful consumer hardware
- Support for multiple users or documents without significant delays

They support `morph`'s vision of enabling fast, local-first, and user-centric machine-assisted writing environments.

### Implementation Verification Plan

In-group code walkthrough inspection is chosen as the main method to complete implementation verification of the project. The coding contents will be reviewed by other team members in exchange asynchronously. Basic grammar error in coding will be caught by linter of each different components. Detailed test cases can be found in system testing.

Final presentation is also expected to be a part of verification of usability, and its feedback will be collected and reflected on the final release.

### Automated Testing and Verification Tools

The following include tools and automated tests that will be used for the verification of the system.

The automated testing strategy for `morph` is divided into two main components: the web-based editor (`morph`) and the ML inference server (`asteraceae`). Each component has specific tooling requirements and testing frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage.

#### Critical Paths

Critical paths refer to components whose failure or malfunction would significantly compromise the system’s core functionality, user experience, or data integrity. These include but are not limited to:

- Handles login flows, token generation, and access control.
- Responsible for data exchange between the Morph frontend and Asteraceae backend, especially those processing user-generated input or returning AI-generated text.
- Modules in Morph that manage file states, local storage, or editing buffers crucial for preserving user content.
- Code that performs text generation, steering operations, or data validation in Asteraceae.
- Interfaces that facilitate or transform information passed between Morph and Asteraceae.

These components are considered *mission-critical* and must meet **100% test coverage** as per the code coverage requirements outlined in section 3.6.5. This classification helps ensure that all high-risk paths are thoroughly validated through automated testing.

#### Automated Testing Requirements

1. **Code Coverage Requirements**

   - Frontend (morph): 80% overall coverage
   - Backend (asteraceae): 85% overall coverage
   - Critical paths: 100% coverage

   **Enforcement Mechanism in CI/CD Pipeline:**

   - CI/CD jobs will run automated test coverage checks after each commit using Cloudflare and Vercel pipelines.
   - If coverage thresholds are not met, merges to the main branch will be blocked using pre-merge checks in the pipeline.
   - Automated coverage reports will be generated by the CI/CD pipeline and shared with the development team.
   - Email notifications will be sent to developers when test coverage requirements are not met, providing details on failed areas.

2. **Performance Testing Thresholds**

   ```javascript
   const performanceThresholds = {
     ttft: "500ms", // Time to First Token
     p95: "2s", // 95th percentile response time
     errorRate: "1%", // Maximum error rate
     throughput: "300", // Tokens per second
   }
   ```

3. **Testing Hooks**

   ```bash
   # Pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit:
     - ruff check
     - eslint
     - prettier
     - type checking

   # Pre-push hooks
   pre-push:

1. One of the most successful aspects of writing this deliverable was refining and polishing the overall structure of the document. I focused on ensuring that the contents were clearly articulated, logically ordered, and stylistically consistent with our other project documents such as the SRS and Hazard Analysis. This alignment helped maintain a unified tone and made the V&V plan easier to follow. I also contributed to ensuring that terminology and references across different sections were cross-checked and synchronized, which improved clarity and cohesion.
2. The main challenge I experienced was the sheer volume of writing involved. Due to the document’s length and depth, it was easy to lose track of structural consistency and test coverage balance across sections. It was also difficult to find the right balance between technical specificity and readability for a diverse audience that includes supervisors, peers, and external reviewers. To address this, I used collaborative writing tools and relied on peer feedback sessions to prioritize clarity and completeness. I also coordinated with team members to divide responsibilities and reduce redundancy, which helped streamline the workload and improve section quality.
3. To complete the V&V process for morph, our team needs skills in dynamic testing to validate responsiveness and functional behavior under real user scenarios. Static analysis is also important for catching performance or security issues early, particularly in the backend. Accessibility testing is essential to ensure the UI meets WCAG standards and is fully keyboard-navigable. Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines is needed to automate testing and enforce quality gates. Finally, proficiency with tools like Jest, Playwright, Postman, axe-core, and Ruff is crucial for implementing tests efficiently across both the frontend and backend.
4. Aaron will focus on dynamic testing by applying tools like k6 directly to components during development, allowing for real-time feedback and iteration. Waleed will strengthen his static analysis skills through tutorials on tools like Ruff and Bandit, providing structured learning for backend quality. Nebras chose to enroll in a web accessibility course to gain a comprehensive foundation before conducting audits. Lucas is using GitHub documentation and example workflows to build and tune the CI/CD pipeline directly in our repo. Across the team, we’ll combine reading tool documentation with pair programming to share knowledge and ensure consistent testing practices.

1. While working on the V&V plan, the process of writing the non-functional requirements section went particularly well. My familiarity with usability, performance, and accessibility testing facilitated a smooth drafting process. Additionally, collaborative efforts from Aaron, Waleed, and Lucas enriched the document by incorporating their insights and ensuring that our approach was comprehensive and aligned with project goals.

2. A significant challenge during the development of the V&V plan was aligning the diverse verification and validation approaches across different sections, which occasionally led to overlapping content or inconsistencies in test case formats. Managing these coordination issues was essential to maintain a coherent document. To resolve this, we held structured review sessions and used version control practices to ensure consistency and uniformity across sections. Regular team meetings and clearly documented responsibilities facilitated alignment, enabling the team to stay on the same page and maintain a clear direction throughout the process.

3. To successfully complete the verification and validation of our project, the team will need to acquire a variety of knowledge and skills. For Aaron, expertise in dynamic testing knowledge is essential to ensure that the interfaces and design components meet quality standards through thorough functional and performance testing. Waleed will need static testing knowledge, focusing on tools for code analysis to detect inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in the ML inference server, ensuring robust backend support. Lucas requires an understanding of specialized tool usage such as for model validation and performance monitoring to effectively contribute to SAE interventions. I would need to acquire front-end testing and accessibility knowledge to build and validate the web-based editor’s functionality, ensuring it is intuitive and inclusive for users.

4. To develop these essential knowledge areas, we have outlined multiple approaches for each skill and explained why each member has chosen their approach. For Aaron’s dynamic testing knowledge, he could either enroll in comprehensive courses focused on functional and performance testing or practice by applying dynamic tests to specific interface components. Aaron prefers the second approach as it provides immediate, practical application to his leadership in design work, which helping him refine testing skills relevant to our project's needs.

   <br/>

   Waleed’s static testing knowledge can be strengthened through tutorials on static code analysis tools or by conducting hands-on analysis using past codebases and open-source projects. Waleed has chosen the tutorial approach for a structured learning path that will directly aid in securing the ML inference server's integrity as he believes it will enable him to build foundational expertise efficiently.

   <br/>

   Lucas can gain proficiency in tool usage through workshops focusing on model validation and performance monitoring or by experimenting with these tools on controlled, smaller-scale projects. Lucas plans to attend workshops as they provide an opportunity to learn from experts and peers, making the process more collaborative and efficient. This is crucial for his role in SAE interventions.

   <br/>

   For my part, to develop front-end testing and accessibility knowledge, I could either enroll in courses that cover web accessibility best practices or work on self-directed projects where I conduct accessibility audits. I will pursue the course option because it offers a systematic approach to learning, ensuring I understand the principles thoroughly and can apply them effectively when developing and validating the web-based editor.

1. Writing this deliverable a better understanding of the project’s core features and functionality. It was particularly helpful in clarifying how specific requirements, like model steering, and version control, fit within our overall vision for morph. Focusing on functional requirements also allowed me to refine my grasp of the system's design goals and limitations, helping ensure that our planned features align with user needs and our technical scope. I also appreciated that the process provided room for collaboration with the team and supervisor, leading to more well-defined requirements.

2. One of the main pain points I encountered was defining the functional scope accurately. There were initial uncertainties about how deeply certain features would be integrated, particularly technical aspects like the extent of model customization and maintaining performance in offline mode. It was challenging to balance the technical ambitions with practical constraints for the project’s first release. To overcome this, I initiated discussions with the team and supervisor to align our understanding and verify our priorities. These conversations clarified the project goals and identified where we could use existing frameworks versus areas that needed custom development.

3. Our team will need a variety of skills to carry out verification and validation:

- Dynamic Testing Knowledge (All Team Members): Understanding how to perform functional and performance testing, especially on features like model responsiveness (TTFT) and interface elements like the LTR panel.
- Static Testing Knowledge (Aaron and Waleed): Knowledge of code analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities or inefficiencies, which will be critical for ensuring robust and secure code.
- Front-End Testing and Accessibility (Nebras): Skills in front-end testing, including accessibility evaluations, to validate that the interface is intuitive and accessible for diverse users.

4.  Dynamic Testing Knowledge:

- Approach 1: Enroll in online courses focused on software testing principles and tools.
- Approach 2: Run dynamic tests on smaller sub-projects or components of morph to gain hands-on experience.
  All team members will apply Approach 2 by testing specific features in isolation as we build them.

Static Testing Knowledge:

- Approach 1: Take specialized tutorials on static code analysis tools.
- Approach 2: Practice static testing techniques on open-source projects or our previous codebases to identify common issues.
  Aaron and Waleed will adopt Approach 1, focusing on tutorials for code analysis. This approach will help build foundational knowledge that can later be applied during morph’s development for continuous quality assurance.

Front-End Testing and Accessibility:

- Approach 1: Complete courses or certifications focused on web accessibility and front-end testing.
- Approach 2: Participate in accessibility hackathons to practice identifying and solving accessibility issues in real-world projects.
  Nebras will pursue Approach 1 by taking a structured course in front-end accessibility. Given the importance of accessibility in our project, formal training will help Nebras systematically learn best practices and testing tools.

  3. The coding language demands us to do unit testing of the components with matching testing tools, like Jest for javascript and pytest for python. This matches the knowledge about static testing knowledge I learned before. <br>
  4. Reading the website for relevant testing frame work usage introduction, and walking through the coding examples of the testing these two ways are recommanded approaches to acquiring the knowledege. The second approach is persued by group members since they can used as template to construct our test and have detailed information about how to construct a unit test. <br>
